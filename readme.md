# Minimal Client

- Clone the repo
- `npm i` or `yarn install`
- `node tasks/dev` or `node tasks\dev` for windows users.

Hack away the stuff and see the result at `http://localhost:9989`.

A note about line endings: make sure that you run the following to tell git not to use CRLF:

```
git config core.autocrlf false
```

Always use `LF` line ending.

## Build

To build the project do `node tasks/build` or `node tasks\build` for windows users.

## TODO

- Add dockerfile.
- Add example for react.
